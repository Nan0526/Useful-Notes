1. The first rule is that they should be really small.  
2. DO ONE THING
3. One level of abstraction per function.
4. When a function seems to need more than two or three arguments, it is likely than some of those arguments ought to be wrapped into a class of their own.   
5. Error handling is one thing!! `try` should be the very first word in the function and that there should be nothing after the `catch/finally` blocks.
